### Module 11 Challenge UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of Project
This webpage provides a dynamic, in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. Users can filter based on criteria. This required adding table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
To seach UFO sightings by city, type the city into the "City" field to the left-hand side of the page. Use lowercase letters. After typing in the city name, press enter on your keyboard. The chart to the right on the screen will update with only sightings in Anchorage. This example shows UFO sightings in Anchorage, Alaska. If there was another "Anchorage" in an other country or state, that would have appeared too in the results.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is the lack of an "update" or "search" button. One has to know that using "enter" or clicking in the next field will update the chart.

Recommendation one. Remove the very long quote about UFO sightings. It is better to use a shorter quote with more impact.
Recommendation two. Allow mulitple search criteria - more than one field to be searched.
