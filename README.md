# Module 11 Challenge UFO Sightings with JavaScript

# Overview of Project
This webpage provides a dynamic, in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. Users can filter multiple criteria at the same times. This required adding table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

# Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)

To seach UFO sightings by city, type the city into the "City" field to the left-hand side of the page. Use lowercase letters. After typing in the city name, press enter on your keyboard. The chart to the right on the screen will update with only sightings in Anchorage, Alaska.
This example uses "anchorage".

# Summary
One drawback of this design is the lack of an "update" or "search" button. One has to know that using "enter" or clicking in the next field will update the chart.

Recommendation one. Remove the very long quote about UFO sightings. It is better to use a shorter quote with more impact.
Recommendation two. Allow mulitple search criteria - more than one field to be searched.
