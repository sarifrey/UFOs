# Summary
One drawback of this design is the lack of an "update" or "search" button. 

Recommendation one. Remove the very long quote about UFO sightings. It is better to use a shorter quote with more impact.
Recommendation two. Include the comments about the UFO sightings. Those provide additional information that users may want to see.
